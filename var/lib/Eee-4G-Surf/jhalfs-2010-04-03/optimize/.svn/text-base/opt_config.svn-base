#    "unset" will cause the variable to be not set
#    instead of just set to null.

#--- List of packages that have issues with jobs control.
#    This list may be different for you.
#    If your MAKEFLAGS don't contains a -jX option, you can set

#--- Default optimization mode
#    This mode is overridden by definitions in opt_override;
#    in this way, packages can be tuned independently.  For example,
#    if you have trouble building a package in the mode set here, add
#    the package to opt_override with a different mode.
#
#    Not set here combined modes of form defOpt_myMode.
#    Combined modes of form modeA_modeB can be set here.
DEF_OPT_MODE=O3pipe


#--- Active optimization variables
#    Variables listed here will be set as defined in the appropriate
#    file in opt_config.d/; others will be ignored.
ACTIVE_OPT_VARS="CFLAGS CXXFLAGS LDFLAGS \
                 OTHER_CFLAGS OTHER_CXXFLAGS OTHER_LDFLAGS"

#--- Load optimization modes
#    To add modes, create a working template..
#      cp opt_config.d/O3pipe opt_config.d/newMode
#    ..and edit it as desired.
#
#    To inherit another mode and add to it, see opt_config.d/O3pipe_march
#    or opt_config.d/defOpt_fPIC as examples for two different ways of
#    doing it.  Given opt_config.d/modeA_modeB_modeC, modeB inherits
#    the optimizations of modeA by sourcing it, and modeC inherits those
#    of modeB (which includes those of modeA).
#
#    Add packages that are to use this mode to opt_override with:
#      echo 'myPkg  newMode' >> opt_override
for mode in optimize/opt_config.d/* ; do
  source $mode
done
